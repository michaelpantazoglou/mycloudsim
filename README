Executing
First Install gradle

Requirments: Java8.

From command line run gradle build. 

Then execute with gradle application plugin
gradle hyperun -Pmyargs=SimulationTime,HypercubeSize,StartingVms,Mode,Vmrate

Where
Simulationtime in hours. Notice that the tool uses a fake event relatef timer, so we are not talking about rwal time

HyperCubeSize
Defined the size of the cube so the number of hosts as where, since number of hosts is 2^HypercubeSize. 

StartingVms 
The Vms to be placed in the Datacenter before the simulation starts

Mode
Increasing (i), standard(s),decreasing(d) and (n) for no vm addition mode. For standard we represent the random addition or removal of a standar fixed number of Virtual Machines. For the other two modes we have either addition or removal.

Vmrate
The rate vms will be add or removed from the datacenter per second.

For example if we execute
HyperCloudsim -3 -4 -50 -i -2 , then we are going to run an experiment for 3 hours, with 8 hosts, starting from 50 vms and 2 vms added per second (with propability 50%).

When execution is completed, the files listed below will have been created in the folder logs-plots
-onhosttime.dat: the hosts that were on at the end of each period
-powertime.dat: the tolat datacenter power consuption during the last period
-vmstime.dat: the virual machines in the datacenter at the end of the period

And the following plots

Notice that the creation of the Vm might fail, if no host is avaliable. So when we talk about the vm rate, we talk about the Vm that the tool will try to crate in the datacenter.
